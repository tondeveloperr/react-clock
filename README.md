# React - 25 + 5 Clock

This is a clock and timer application built using React, Vite, and TypeScript. It allows users to set and manage both break and session times for a Pomodoro-style timer. The application provides a visual countdown and an alarm sound when the timer reaches zero. Users can customize the timer duration for both break and session times according to their needs. It's a handy tool for maintaining productivity and taking regular breaks during work or study sessions.
